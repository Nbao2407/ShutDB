# Toolbar Balance & Organization Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced toolbar layout and organization at all screen sizes, with special focus on larger displays to ensure proper balance and visual hierarchy.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Toolbar Layout Structure** (`App.css`)
- **Changed justification**: `flex-start` → `space-between` for better distribution of elements
- **Adjusted gap**: Increased to 16px for better visual separation
- **Improved padding**: Fine-tuned to 10px 16px for proportional spacing
- **Better background**: Refined opacity for cleaner glass morphism effect

### 2. **Search Input Sizing** (`SearchAndFilter.module.css`)
- **Desktop (1200px+)**: Reduced from 350px to 280px for better balance
- **Removed excessive width**: Prevents search from dominating large screens
- **Maintained usability**: Still comfortable for typical search queries

### 3. **Toolbar Section Proportions** (`App.css`)
- **toolbar-search flex**: Changed from `flex: 1 1 auto` → `flex: 0 1 auto`
  - Prevents growth beyond max-width
  - Ensures predictable sizing across screen sizes
- **Added max-width constraint**: 500px on large screens
- **Better min-width**: Set to 200px for minimum usable size

### 4. **Responsive Breakpoints**

#### Large Screens (1200px+)
- Toolbar padding: 10px 18px (improved spacing)
- Gap between elements: 16px
- Search max-width: 350px (controlled sizing)
- Full labels shown (Services, Running, Stopped)

#### Ultra Large Screens (1600px+)
- Toolbar max-width: 1400px
- Centered alignment with auto margins
- Prevents toolbar from stretching across entire screen width

### 5. **Visual Balance Improvements**
- **Prevents search dominance**: Limited growth ensures balanced appearance
- **Better element spacing**: Increased gaps create visual separation
- **Proportional padding**: Toolbar feels less cramped on large screens
- **Centered content**: Ultra-large screens now have centered, organized toolbar

## Result
✅ Toolbar is now properly organized and balanced at all sizes
✅ Search input doesn't dominate large screens
✅ Better visual hierarchy with improved spacing
✅ Responsive design maintains usability at all breakpoints
✅ Professional appearance with clean glass morphism design

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test at 1200px, 1400px, 1600px, and beyond
2. Verify search input size is proportional to window size
3. Confirm toolbar remains visually balanced
4. Check that buttons/controls are properly spaced
