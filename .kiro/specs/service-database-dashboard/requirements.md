# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Service Database Dashboard is a lightweight desktop application that enables users to manage database services (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.) installed on their local machine. The application provides a simple graphical interface for starting, stopping, and restarting database services while maintaining minimal resource consumption (target: <50MB passive RAM usage). Built with Wails v2 framework, it combines a Go backend with a React TypeScript frontend.

## Glossary

- **Dashboard Application**: The Service Database Dashboard desktop application
- **Database Service**: A system service for database management systems such as PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- **Service Manager**: The backend component responsible for interacting with operating system service management APIs
- **Control Panel**: The frontend user interface displaying database services and control buttons
- **Service Status**: The current operational state of a database service (running, stopped, or transitioning)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view all installed database services on my machine, so that I can see which databases are available for management

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Dashboard Application starts, THE Dashboard Application SHALL retrieve all installed database services from the operating system
2. THE Dashboard Application SHALL display each detected database service with its name and current status in the Control Panel
3. WHEN a database service status changes, THE Dashboard Application SHALL update the displayed status within 2 seconds
4. THE Dashboard Application SHALL support detection of PostgreSQL services on the host system
5. THE Dashboard Application SHALL support detection of MongoDB services on the host system

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to start a stopped database service, so that I can make the database available for my applications

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the start button for a stopped service, THE Dashboard Application SHALL send a start command to the Service Manager
2. WHEN the Service Manager receives a start command, THE Service Manager SHALL execute the operating system service start operation
3. IF the service start operation succeeds, THEN THE Dashboard Application SHALL update the service status to running
4. IF the service start operation fails, THEN THE Dashboard Application SHALL display an error message with the failure reason
5. WHILE a service start operation is in progress, THE Dashboard Application SHALL disable the start button and show a loading indicator

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to stop a running database service, so that I can free up system resources when the database is not needed

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the stop button for a running service, THE Dashboard Application SHALL send a stop command to the Service Manager
2. WHEN the Service Manager receives a stop command, THE Service Manager SHALL execute the operating system service stop operation
3. IF the service stop operation succeeds, THEN THE Dashboard Application SHALL update the service status to stopped
4. IF the service stop operation fails, THEN THE Dashboard Application SHALL display an error message with the failure reason
5. WHILE a service stop operation is in progress, THE Dashboard Application SHALL disable the stop button and show a loading indicator

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to restart a database service, so that I can apply configuration changes or recover from service errors

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the restart button for any service, THE Dashboard Application SHALL send a restart command to the Service Manager
2. WHEN the Service Manager receives a restart command, THE Service Manager SHALL execute the operating system service restart operation
3. IF the service restart operation succeeds, THEN THE Dashboard Application SHALL update the service status to running
4. IF the service restart operation fails, THEN THE Dashboard Application SHALL display an error message with the failure reason
5. WHILE a service restart operation is in progress, THE Dashboard Application SHALL disable all control buttons for that service and show a loading indicator

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to consume minimal system resources, so that it does not impact my development environment performance

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Dashboard Application is running in idle state, THE Dashboard Application SHALL consume less than 50 megabytes of RAM
2. THE Dashboard Application SHALL poll service status at intervals no more frequent than every 5 seconds
3. THE Dashboard Application SHALL use native operating system APIs for service management to minimize overhead
4. THE Dashboard Application SHALL render the Control Panel using lightweight UI components
5. WHEN the Dashboard Application window is minimized, THE Dashboard Application SHALL reduce background activity to status polling only

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple and intuitive interface, so that I can quickly manage services without learning complex controls

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Control Panel SHALL display each service as a single row with service name, status, and action buttons
2. THE Control Panel SHALL use clearly labeled buttons for Start, Stop, and Restart actions
3. THE Control Panel SHALL use color coding to indicate service status (green for running, red for stopped, yellow for transitioning)
4. THE Control Panel SHALL display all services in a single scrollable list
5. THE Dashboard Application SHALL provide visual feedback within 200 milliseconds of any user interaction

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Windows user, I want the application to work with Windows service management, so that I can manage database services on my Windows machine

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Windows operating system, THE Service Manager SHALL use Windows Service Control Manager APIs
2. THE Service Manager SHALL require appropriate permissions to manage Windows services
3. IF the Dashboard Application lacks required permissions, THEN THE Dashboard Application SHALL display a clear error message requesting administrator privileges
4. THE Service Manager SHALL detect PostgreSQL services registered with Windows Service Control Manager
5. THE Service Manager SHALL detect MongoDB services registered with Windows Service Control Manager
