# Manual Testing Guide - Service Database Dashboard

## Prerequisites

Before starting the tests, ensure:
- [ ] Application is built (`wails build` completed successfully)
- [ ] You have PostgreSQL and/or MongoDB installed on your system
- [ ] You know the service names (check Windows Services: `services.msc`)
- [ ] You have both admin and non-admin test scenarios ready

## Test Environment Setup

1. **Identify your database services:**
   - Open Windows Services (`Win + R` â†’ `services.msc`)
   - Note the exact service names for PostgreSQL (e.g., "postgresql-x64-14")
   - Note the exact service names for MongoDB (e.g., "MongoDB")

2. **Prepare test scenarios:**
   - Have at least one service in STOPPED state
   - Have at least one service in RUNNING state

### Error Case:
If the operation fails:
- [ ] Error message is displayed with failure reason

- [ ] Buttons return to appropriate enabled/disabled state

### Notes:
_Record any issues or observations here_

3. Observe the UI changes

### Expected Results:
- [ ] Stop button becomes disabled immediately
- [ ] Loading indicator appears on the service row
- [ ] Status changes to "stopping" (yellow indicator)
- [ ] Within 30 seconds, status changes to "stopped" (red indicator)

- [ ] Start button becomes enabled
- [ ] No error messages appear
- [ ] Visual feedback appears within 200ms of clicking

### Error Case:
If the operation fails:
- [ ] Error message is displayed with failure reason
- [ ] Service status reflects actual state
- [ ] Buttons return to appropriate enabled/disabled state

### Notes:
_Record any issues or observations here_

## Test Case 4: Restart Operation

**Requirements:** 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5

### Steps:

2. Click the "Restart" button for that service
3. Observe the UI changes

### Expected Results:
- [ ] All buttons (Start, Stop, Restart) become disabled immediately
- [ ] Loading indicator appears on the service row
- [ ] Status changes to "restarting" (yellow indicator)
- [ ] Within 60 seconds, status changes to "running" (green indicator)
- [ ] Buttons return to appropriate enabled/disabled state
- [ ] No error messages appear
- [ ] Visual feedback appears within 200ms of clicking

### Error Case:
If the operation fails:
- [ ] Error message is displayed with failure reason
- [ ] Service status reflects actual state
- [ ] Buttons return to appropriate enabled/disabled state

### Notes:
_Record any issues or observations here_

## Test Case 5: Status Updates Within 2 Seconds

**Requirements:** 1.3, 5.2, 5.5

### Steps:
1. With the application running, open Windows Services (`services.msc`)
2. Manually change a service state from Windows Services
3. Observe the dashboard application

### Expected Results:
- [ ] Dashboard detects the status change within 5 seconds (polling interval)
- [ ] Status indicator updates to reflect new state
- [ ] Color coding updates correctly
- [ ] Button states update appropriately

### Additional Test:
1. Perform a Start/Stop operation from the dashboard
2. Time how long it takes for the status to update after operation completes

### Expected Results:
- [ ] Status updates within 2 seconds of operation completion
- [ ] No manual refresh needed

### Notes:
_Record any issues or observations here_
